# Algos training

This repo contains solutions of different tasks related to algorithms and data structures
implemented in different languages:

- ~~Java (legacy)~~
- ~~Python (legacy)~~
- **Kotlin (active)**
- **Go (active)**
- **SQL (active)**

If some filename does not contain task number, then it's just not from LeetCode :)
