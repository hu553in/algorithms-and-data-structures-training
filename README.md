# Algorithms & data structures training

This repo contains solutions of different tasks related to algorithms and data structures
implemented in different languages:

- Java (legacy)
- Python (legacy)
- Kotlin (active)
- Go (active)
- SQL (active)

If some filename does not contain task number, then it's just not from LeetCode :)
